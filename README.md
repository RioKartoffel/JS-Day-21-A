Kinetic CSS Loader

This mini project has no javascript as these codes are for a simple Kinetic Loader animation that can be displayed on a webpage.

The HTML code sets up the basic structure of the webpage with a div element that has a class of "kinetic" and includes links to a CSS file and a title for the webpage.

The CSS code defines the styles for the "kinetic" element, which creates a spinning animation that looks like a loading spinner. The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to create two triangles that rotate around the center of the element, giving the illusion of a spinning wheel. The @keyframes rule is used to define the animations for the two triangles.

Overall, the code creates a simple but visually appealing kinetic loader animation that can be used as a loading spinner on a webpage.
